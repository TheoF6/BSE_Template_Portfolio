# Custom MIDI Controller
A MIDI controller is a device used to control Digital Audio Workstations, or DAWs. They typically come with many buttons, keys, and dials that the user can physically interact with to create sounds in the audio software. My project was to make a MIDI controller that can control Ableton live, a DAW.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone of the project was creating the circuit for the controller and getting it to send a signal to the computer. To do this, I followed the provided Instructables instructions for how to wire the circuit. It is a fairly simple input circuit, with a few potentiometers and push buttons connected to an Arduino. Next, I uploaded the code that is used for custom MIDI controllers to the Arduino. With the code, the Arduino was able to tell when an input was being changed, and when that happened a signal was sent to the serial port in the Arduino software. The signal is unintelligable because a MIDI signal is being sent across a serial port, and MIDI signals must be converted across a MIDI port in order to be read.
